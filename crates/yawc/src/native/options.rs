///
/// `Options` allows comprehensive control over WebSocket connection behavior, including:
/// - **Payload size limits**: Control memory usage and prevent abuse
/// - **Compression**: Reduce bandwidth using permessage-deflate (RFC 7692)
/// - **Fragmentation**: Handle large messages
/// - **UTF-8 validation**: Ensure text frame compliance
/// - **TCP options**: Fine-tune network behavior
///
/// # Protocol Layers
///
/// The WebSocket implementation is organized into distinct processing layers:
///
/// ## 1. Fragmentation Layer
/// Handles splitting and reassembling messages across multiple frames. Controlled by
/// [`Options::fragmentation`] (see [`Fragmentation`] for details).
///
/// - **Outgoing**: Automatically fragments large messages when [`Fragmentation::fragment_size`] is set
/// - **Incoming**: Automatically reassembles fragments into complete messages before delivery
///
/// ## 2. Compression Layer
/// Applies permessage-deflate compression to reduce bandwidth. Controlled by
/// [`Options::compression`] (see [`DeflateOptions`] for details).
///
/// - Operates on complete messages (after fragmentation/before defragmentation)
/// - Can be configured with different compression levels and context takeover modes
/// - Negotiated during the WebSocket handshake
///
/// # Common Patterns
///
/// ## Basic Configuration
/// ```rust
/// use yawc::Options;
///
/// let options = Options::default()
///     .with_max_payload_read(1024 * 1024) // 1 MiB max incoming
///     .with_utf8(); // Validate text frames
/// ```
///
/// ## CPU and Memory-Constrained Environment
/// ```rust
/// use yawc::Options;
///
/// let options = Options::default()
///     .with_limits(128 * 1024, 256 * 1024) // Small payload/buffer limits
///     .without_compression(); // Avoid compression overhead
