//! Split read/write halves for WebSocket connections.
//!
//! # Architecture Layer: Fragment Assembly
//!
//! This module implements the **middle layer** of the WebSocket processing stack,
//! sitting between the codec layer and the WebSocket layer. Its primary responsibility
//! is **fragment assembly** according to RFC 6455.
//!
//! ## ReadHalf Responsibilities
//!
//! [`ReadHalf`] handles fragmented message assembly:
//!
//! - **Fragment accumulation**: Collects continuation frames into complete messages
//! - **State tracking**: Maintains fragment state (opcode, compression flag, accumulated data)
//! - **Fragment timeout**: Enforces timeouts on incomplete fragmented messages
//! - **Size limits**: Enforces maximum message size after assembly
//! - **Masking removal**: Removes frame masks to prevent accidental echo
//!
//! ## What ReadHalf Does NOT Handle
//!
//! - **Frame decoding**: Handled by [`Codec`](crate::codec::Codec)
//! - **Decompression**: Handled by [`WebSocket`](crate::WebSocket)
//! - **UTF-8 validation**: Handled by [`WebSocket`](crate::WebSocket)
//!
//! ## Data Flow Example
//!
//! **Receiving a fragmented message:**
//!
//! ```text
//! Codec → ReadHalf:
//!   Frame(OpCode::Text, FIN=0, "Hello")
//!     → ReadHalf: Start accumulating, return None
//!
//!   Frame(OpCode::Continuation, FIN=0, " Wor")
//!     → ReadHalf: Continue accumulating, return None
//!
//!   Frame(OpCode::Continuation, FIN=1, "ld!")
//!     → ReadHalf: Assemble complete message
//!     → Returns Frame(OpCode::Text, FIN=1, "Hello World!")
//! ```
//!
//! ## WriteHalf Responsibilities
//!
//! [`WriteHalf`] handles frame transmission with compression support:
//!
//! - **Compression**: Compresses frames when permessage-deflate is enabled
//! - **Masking**: Applies masks to client frames (required by RFC 6455)
//! - **Connection closure**: Manages graceful WebSocket closure protocol
//!
//! # Sans-IO Design
//!
//! This module implements a **sans-io** (I/O-free) design pattern where the protocol logic
//! is completely separated from the I/O operations.
//!
//! ## Benefits
//!
//! 1. **Testability**: Protocol logic can be tested without actual network I/O
//! 2. **Transport Agnostic**: Works with TCP, Unix sockets, in-memory buffers, or custom transports
//! 3. **Flexibility**: Users can implement custom flow control and buffering strategies
//! 4. **Performance**: Enables zero-copy optimizations in user code
//!
//! # Thread Safety Through `split()`
//!
//! WebSocket connections can be split into separate read and write halves for concurrent
//! operation. This is achieved through the `split()` method on `WebSocket`:
//!
//! ## Using `futures::StreamExt::split()` (Recommended)
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use futures::{SinkExt, StreamExt};
//! use yawc::{Frame, WebSocket};
//!
//! # async fn example() -> yawc::Result<()> {
//! let ws = WebSocket::connect("wss://example.com".parse()?).await?;
//!
//! // Split into read and write halves
//! let (mut write, mut read) = ws.split();
//!
//! // Spawn a task to read messages
//! tokio::spawn(async move {
//!     while let Some(frame) = read.next().await {
//!         println!("Received: {:?}", frame.opcode());
//!     }
//! });
//!
//! // Write from the main task
//! write.send(Frame::text("Hello!")).await?;
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Thread Safety Guarantees
//!
//! 1. **No Shared Mutable State**: Read and write halves operate independently with no
//!    shared mutable state between them.
//!
//! 2. **Borrowing Rules**: Rust's ownership system ensures only one task can access each
//!    half at a time, preventing data races at compile time.
//!
//! 3. **Send + Sync**: Both halves implement `Send`, allowing them to be moved across
//!    thread boundaries safely.
//!
//! 4. **Protocol Correctness**: Each half maintains its own protocol state (fragmentation,
//!    compression windows) ensuring WebSocket protocol correctness even with concurrent
//!    read/write operations.
//!
//! ## Low-Level `split_stream()` (Advanced)
//!
//! For advanced use cases requiring direct access to the underlying stream and protocol
//! handlers, use the unsafe `split_stream()` method:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use yawc::WebSocket;
//! # async fn example() -> yawc::Result<()> {
//! let ws = WebSocket::connect("wss://example.com".parse()?).await?;
//!
//! // SAFETY: User must ensure the stream is not used after splitting
//! let (mut stream, mut read_half, mut write_half) = unsafe { ws.split_stream() };
//!
//! // Manual protocol handling required
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! **Warning**: This is unsafe because it requires manual protocol handling. Users must:
//! - Correctly handle control frames (Ping, Pong, Close)
//! - Maintain proper message ordering
//! - Handle compression state correctly
//!
//! Prefer `futures::StreamExt::split()` unless you have specific low-level requirements.

// ================ ReadHalf ====================

/// The read half of a WebSocket connection, responsible for receiving and processing incoming messages.
///
/// [`ReadHalf`] follows a sans-io design, meaning it does not handle I/O operations directly.
/// Instead, the user must provide a [`futures::Stream`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.Stream.html)
/// of frames on each function call. This allows the ReadHalf to be I/O agnostic and work with any underlying transport.
///
/// [`ReadHalf`] handles decompression and message fragmentation but does not manage WebSocket control frames.
/// Users are responsible for handling frames with [`OpCode::Ping`], [`OpCode::Pong`], and [`OpCode::Close`] codes.
///
/// After a [`OpCode::Close`] frame is received, the [`ReadHalf`] will no longer accept reads and will
/// return a [`WebSocketError::ConnectionClosed`] error for all subsequent read attempts.
///
/// # Warning
///
/// In most cases, you should **not** use [`ReadHalf`] directly. Instead, use
/// [`futures::StreamExt::split`](https://docs.rs/futures/latest/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.split)
/// on the [`WebSocket`](super::WebSocket) to obtain a stream split that maintains all WebSocket protocol handling.
/// Direct use of [`ReadHalf`] bypasses important protocol management like automatic control frame handling.
///
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// use std::{pin::Pin, task::Context};
///
/// use futures::StreamExt;
/// use tokio::net::TcpStream;
/// use tokio_rustls::TlsConnector;

///     let url = "wss://api.example.com/ws".parse()?;
///     let ws = WebSocket::connect(url).await?;
